# The Internet

This is a little project I made for the [Hackerspace of Gent](https://hackerspace.gent), as a way to learn 3D designing and printing using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).

It uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W to connect to the actual internet and performs a ping at regular intervals.
The proper functioning of the internet is reflected by the status of the red LED.
